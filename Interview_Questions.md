## 1. What is _Git_ and why is it used?

**Git** is a decentralized version control system (**DVCS**) that developers primarily use to manage source code across diverse development projects. It ensures better code quality, facilitates teamwork, and provides a robust backup mechanism.

### Benefits of Using Git

- **History and Time Travel**: Git preserves every version of a project, making it possible to roll back changes or inspect code at any point.

- **Security and Integrity**: Each file in Git has a unique SHA-1 hash, which means unauthorized changes are easily detected.

- **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without conflict.

- **Code Reviews**: Git simplifies the process of reviewing code before it's incorporated into the main codebase.

### Key Concepts

#### Commit

A **commit** represents a saved state of your project. It is a snapshot of all the files in your project at a given point in time. Each commit has a commit message associated with it.

#### Branch

A **branch** is an independent line of development. It allows you to work on a feature or bug fix, isolate it from the rest of the codebase until it is ready, and then merge it back in.
