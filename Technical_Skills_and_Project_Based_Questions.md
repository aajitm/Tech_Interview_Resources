# Technical Skills and Project-Based Questions
## 1. ASP.NET Core and MVC:
- Can you describe a challenging problem you've encountered while working with ASP.NET Core or ASP.NET MVC, and how you resolved it?
- How do you handle session management and state in web applications developed in ASP.NET?
### Answers
- **Challenging Problem**: In a previous project, I faced an issue with session state management when deploying an ASP.NET MVC application on a cloud server. The default in-memory session state wasnâ€™t viable for scalability. I resolved this by implementing a distributed cache using Redis, which allowed session data to be shared across multiple instances of the application. This improved performance and ensured that user sessions remained consistent.
- **Session Management**: I typically use cookie-based session management for web applications. For applications needing persistent sessions, I prefer using distributed session state providers like SQL Server or Redis, ensuring that session data remains available across server instances.
