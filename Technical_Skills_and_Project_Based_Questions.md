### Answers

#### Commit

A **commit** represents a saved state of your project. It is a snapshot of all the files in your project at a given point in time. Each commit has a commit message associated with it.

#### Branch

A **branch** is an independent line of development. It allows you to work on a feature or bug fix, isolate it from the rest of the codebase until it is ready, and then merge it back in.
