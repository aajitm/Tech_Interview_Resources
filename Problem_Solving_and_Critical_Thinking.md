# Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking

## 1. Debugging and Troubleshooting:
- What is your approach to identifying and resolving production issues in web applications?
- Can you describe a challenging bug you encountered and how you diagnosed and resolved it?
### Answers
- **Approach to Production Issues**: I use logging extensively to monitor application behavior in production. For instance, I implemented Serilog in my applications, which helped trace issues quickly. I also perform root cause analysis to prevent similar problems in the future.
- **Challenging Bug Example**: In the Integration-Reconciliation System, I encountered a critical bug that caused data mismatches during reconciliation. I conducted a thorough investigation, identified a timing issue in data processing, and implemented a retry mechanism to ensure data consistency.

## 2. Handling Client Requirements:
- How do you gather and clarify requirements to ensure that client expectations are met?
- Describe a time when client requirements changed significantly. How did you manage the change?
### Answers
- **Gathering Requirements**: I conduct workshops and interviews with clients to clarify requirements, ensuring all stakeholders are aligned. This was particularly effective during the development of the Hotel ERP system, where requirements were complex and varied.
- **Managing Requirement Changes**: When faced with significant changes in requirements, I worked with the client to prioritize changes based on impact and feasibility, ensuring that critical functionalities were developed first without disrupting the project timeline.
