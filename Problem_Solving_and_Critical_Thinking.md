# Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking

## 1. Debugging and Troubleshooting:
- What is your approach to identifying and resolving production issues in web applications?
- Can you describe a challenging bug you encountered and how you diagnosed and resolved it?
### Answers
- **Mentoring Approach**: I conduct regular knowledge-sharing sessions and code reviews, focusing on best practices and design principles. For instance, I helped junior developers understand SOLID principles through practical examples during code review sessions.
- **Code Review Process**: I ensure code reviews are constructive by providing feedback on both functionality and maintainability, encouraging discussions that help improve the overall quality of the codebase.

## 2. Handling Client Requirements:
- How do you gather and clarify requirements to ensure that client expectations are met?
- Describe a time when client requirements changed significantly. How did you manage the change?
