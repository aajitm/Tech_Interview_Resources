# Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking

## 1. Debugging and Troubleshooting:
- What is your approach to identifying and resolving production issues in web applications?
- Can you describe a challenging bug you encountered and how you diagnosed and resolved it?
### Answers
- **Approach to Production Issues**: I use logging extensively to monitor application behavior in production. For instance, I implemented Serilog in my applications, which helped trace issues quickly. I also perform root cause analysis to prevent similar problems in the future.
- **Challenging Bug Example**: In the Integration-Reconciliation System, I encountered a critical bug that caused data mismatches during reconciliation. I conducted a thorough investigation, identified a timing issue in data processing, and implemented a retry mechanism to ensure data consistency.

## 2. Handling Client Requirements:
- How do you gather and clarify requirements to ensure that client expectations are met?
- Describe a time when client requirements changed significantly. How did you manage the change?
### Answers
- **Gathering Requirements**: I conduct workshops and interviews with clients to clarify requirements, ensuring all stakeholders are aligned. This was particularly effective during the development of the Hotel ERP system, where requirements were complex and varied.
- **Managing Requirement Changes**: When faced with significant changes in requirements, I worked with the client to prioritize changes based on impact and feasibility, ensuring that critical functionalities were developed first without disrupting the project timeline.

## 3. Handling Ambiguity:
- How do you approach projects with vague requirements or rapidly changing specifications?
- Describe a situation where you had to make a decision with incomplete information. What was the outcome?
### Answers
- **Approaching Vague Requirements**: I initiate a discovery phase with stakeholders to clarify requirements and expectations. For example, in the Hotel ERP project, I conducted workshops to gather detailed user stories.
- **Decision-Making with Incomplete Information**: When faced with a decision regarding technology stack with limited data, I gathered insights from similar projects and consulted team members, leading to a well-informed decision that proved successful.

## 4. Technical Challenges:
- Can you share an instance where you faced a significant technical challenge in a project? How did you approach solving it?
- What strategies do you employ to stay updated on the latest technologies and industry trends?
### Answers
- **Facing Technical Challenges**: In one project, we encountered significant performance issues due to high traffic. I led the team in analyzing bottlenecks and implementing caching strategies, which improved response times significantly.
- **Staying Updated**: I regularly attend webinars, read tech blogs, and participate in online communities. I also encourage my team to share interesting articles and tools they discover.
