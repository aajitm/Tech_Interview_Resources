# Team Leadership and Mentoring

## 1. Mentoring Junior Developers:
- Describe your approach to mentoring junior developers. How do you help them improve their technical skills and code quality?
- How do you handle code reviews? What do you look for to ensure the code meets quality standards?
### Answers
- **Mentoring Approach**: I conduct regular knowledge-sharing sessions and code reviews, focusing on best practices and design principles. For instance, I helped junior developers understand SOLID principles through practical examples during code review sessions.
- **Code Review Process**: I ensure code reviews are constructive by providing feedback on both functionality and maintainability, encouraging discussions that help improve the overall quality of the codebase.

## 2. Team Collaboration and Cross-Functional Coordination:
- How do you ensure effective communication and collaboration across cross-functional teams?
- Can you describe a situation where you had to mediate a technical disagreement within your team?
### Answers
- **Ensuring Effective Communication**: I facilitate regular cross-team meetings to align project goals and timelines, using tools like Slack for ongoing communication. This helps address any inter-team dependencies and fosters collaboration.
- **Mediating Technical Disagreements**: In cases of technical disagreements, I encourage team members to present their viewpoints and facilitate discussions to find a consensus, focusing on project objectives and data-driven decision-making.

## 3. Project Ownership and Decision-Making:
- As a team lead, how do you balance project deadlines with technical debt and code quality?
- What steps do you take when making critical technical decisions that impact the projectâ€™s direction?
### Answers
- **Balancing Deadlines and Quality**: I emphasize the importance of quality in every phase of development. If project timelines are tight, I advocate for prioritizing critical features while planning for technical debt remediation in future sprints.
- **Making Critical Technical Decisions**: I gather input from team members and stakeholders to make informed decisions. For example, when deciding to adopt a new framework, I presented a cost-benefit analysis to ensure the team was aligned with the technology choice.
