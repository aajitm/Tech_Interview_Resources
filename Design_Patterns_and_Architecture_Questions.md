# Design Patterns and Architecture Questions

## 1. Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Repository, CQRS):
- Can you give examples of when and how you've implemented design patterns like Singleton or Factory in your projects?
- How would you implement the CQRS pattern in a system that requires complex data operations?
### Answers
- **Implementation Examples**: I used the Singleton pattern to manage database connections in the Hotel ERP system, ensuring only one instance was active at any time. The Factory pattern was employed to create different types of reports based on user requests.
- **CQRS Pattern Implementation**: In the Workforce Management system, I applied the CQRS pattern to separate read and write operations, improving performance and allowing independent scaling of queries and commands.

## 2. Scalability and Performance:
- How do you approach designing applications for scalability? Can you share any specific strategies used in your projects?
- What are some best practices you follow to improve application performance?
### Answers
- **Designing for Scalability**: I follow microservices architecture principles to design applications that can be scaled independently. In the Vehicle Recycling System, I divided the application into services based on business capabilities, which allowed for independent scaling of each service.
- **Best Practices for Performance**: I implement caching strategies at various levels (application-level, database-level) and monitor application performance using tools like Application Insights to identify and resolve bottlenecks promptly.
